## 2. Core Components & Flow

### 2.1 BCI Interface

* **Acquisition**: Captures multi-modal brainwave (EEG/MEG) data in real-time.
* **Preprocessing**: Filters noise, normalizes signal amplitudes, and segments activity epochs.
* **Output**: Structured neural time-series passed to the Neural Mapper.

### 2.2 Neural Mapper

* **Scan Import**: Ingests high-resolution brain scans (e.g., NIfTI, DICOM) and live BCI data.
* **Model Generation**: Builds voxel-level neural networks reflecting anatomical and functional connectivity.
* **Export**: Generates a computational graph representing the user’s mental architecture.

### 2.3 Emulation Runtime

* **Scheduler**: Orchestrates discrete “consciousness threads” for parallel execution.
* **State Manager**: Maintains time-stamped checkpoints of mental states for rollback and branching.
* **Persistence**: Serializes context snapshots into `data/` for long-term storage.

### 2.4 Identity Manager

* **Snapshot & Restore**: Provides APIs to capture full identity states and resume them on demand.
* **Versioning**: Tags each snapshot with metadata (timestamp, source, module versions).
* **Continuity**: Ensures thread-safe transitions between physical and digital substrates.

### 2.5 Logic Engine

* **Rule Core** (`law_core.py`): Defines `Law` objects with activation functions that transform context.
* **Dynamic Expander**: Uses AI-driven assistants to generate new laws in response to changing tech contexts.
* **Evaluation Loop**: Applies registered laws to each context update within the Emulation Runtime.

### 2.6 Physics Engine

* **Field Simulator**: Executes programmable physics laws (gravity, entropy, custom axioms).
* **Infinite Reality**: Supports multiverse-like extension, enabling branching universes per snapshot.
* **Interoperability**: Consumes logic-engine outputs to mutate physical rules on-the-fly.

### 2.7 Eternal Evolution Protocol

* **Law Mutation**: Automatically forks and refines physics or logic rules based on usage metrics.
* **Module Hot-Swap**: Allows live replacement of modules (e.g., updated BCI drivers) without downtime.

### 2.8 Simulation Orchestrator

* **Node Manager**: Distributes simulation workloads across Docker containers or cloud nodes.
* **Synchronization**: Coordinates data consistency between distributed Emulation Runtimes.

### 2.9 Visualization GUI

* **3D Rendering**: Renders identity waveforms, field lines, and active logic flows in Blender/WebGL.
* **Interactive Controls**: Pause, rewind, and branch simulations; inject new laws or forces live.
* **Analytics Dashboard**: Displays metrics (latency, entropy levels, law-application counts).

## 4. Extensibility & Integration

* **Plugin System**: Drop-in modules under `src/advanced_modules/` auto-discovered by Emulation Runtime.
* **API Endpoints**: REST & WebSocket interfaces for external control or third-party integrations.
* **Data Export**: Support for standard neuroscience formats (HDF5, NeuroML) and custom JSON schemas.
