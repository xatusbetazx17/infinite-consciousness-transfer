# Detailed Transfer & Emulation Models

This document outlines the algorithms, data structures, and process flows that underpin the precise transfer and real-time emulation of consciousness within the Infinite Consciousness Transfer Framework.

Each stage transforms context from one representation to the next, ensuring fidelity and continuity of conscious state.

## 2. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

1. **Multi-Modal Input:**

   * **Structural Scans** (MRI, DICOM, NIfTI): High-resolution anatomical data.
   * **Functional Streams** (EEG/MEG time-series): Real-time electrical activity.
2. **Normalization & Denoising:**

   * Bandpass filtering for EEG (1–100 Hz).
   * Spatial smoothing on volumetric scans (Gaussian kernel).
3. **Segmentation:**

   * Anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) via atlas lookup.
   * Epoch segmentation for temporal analysis.

---

## 3. Neural Reconstruction Model

* **Voxel Graph Construction:**

  * Nodes represent 3D voxels or ROIs; edges weighted by white-matter tract density.
  * Graph stored as sparse adjacency matrix.
* **Parameter Mapping:**

  * Assign activation functions (e.g., leaky ReLU) per node based on local neurotransmitter profiles.
  * Synaptic strengths derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics.
* **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Layer:**

  * Performs message passing to simulate local neuronal interactions.
  * Custom layer: `VoxelPropagation(conv_dim, activation_fn)`.

---

## 4. Emulation Pipeline

1. **Initialization:**

   * Load reconstructed graph into memory (`EmulationRuntime.load_graph()`).
   * Instantiate thread scheduler with graph partitioning for parallelism.
2. **Thread Spawning:**

   * Each “consciousness thread” corresponds to a functional subnet (e.g., motor cortex, memory subsystem).
   * Scheduler maintains dependencies via directed acyclic graph (DAG).
3. **Time-Stepping Loop:**

   * At each tick:

     1. Collect inputs from BCI or previous state.
     2. Propagate activations through GNN layers.
     3. Apply Logic Engine transformations.
     4. Update context and record for persistence.

## 5. Identity Binding & Context Management

* **Context Object:**

  * Encapsulates current activation vectors, metadata (timestamp, module versions), and identity ID.
* **Binding Mechanism:**

  * `IdentityBinder.bind(context, target_substrate)` maps digital context to output interface (e.g., robotic body, virtual avatar).
* **Continuity Assurance:**

  * Checksums and cryptographic hashes ensure context integrity across transfers.

---

## 6. Memory Shard Emulation

* **Shard Definition:**

  * Discrete memory segments (episodic, semantic) serialized as JSON or binary blobs.
* **Recombination:**

  * `MemoryShards.inject(context, shard_id)` dynamically merges external or archived shards.
* **Version Control:**

  * Each shard tagged with semantic metadata (source, priority, timestamp).

---

## 7. Checkpointing & Persistence

* **Snapshot API:**

  * `SnapshotManager.create(context)` captures full context state (GNN weights + activation vectors).
* **Storage Backend:**

  * Filesystem or object store (HDF5, S3) with indexing by identity ID and timestamp.
* **Rollback & Branching:**

  * Load any snapshot via `SnapshotManager.restore(snapshot_ref)` to resume or fork execution.

---

## 8. Fidelity Validation & Metrics

* **Round-Trip Tests:**

  * Stimulate original BCI input → emulate → compare output patterns against recorded neural data.
* **Error Metrics:**

  * Mean squared error on activation vectors.
  * Topological similarity score for graph structure (Graph Edit Distance).
* **Continuous Monitoring:**

  * `Validator.run(context_history)` checks drift and flags deviations.

---

## 9. API & Integration Points

* **Python SDK:**

  * `import emulation_runtime as er`
  * Key methods: `load_graph()`, `step()`, `bind()`, `snapshot()`.
* **REST Interface:**

  * `POST /api/v1/emulate` with scan payload returns context URL.
* **WebSocket Streaming:**

  * Real-time activation updates at `/ws/contexts/{id}`.
